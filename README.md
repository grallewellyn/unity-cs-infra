# unity-cs-infra

Framework code which allows for configuration of an AWS environment necessary to do the things that U-CS needs to :
 * build (perhaps not for all service areas -- but offered if they want it)
 * unit test
 * publish
 * integration tests. (run U-CS end)
 * deploy (U-CS)
 * etc..

This repo also houses the GitHub actions (push-button for now) that can trigger builds, tests, etc..
